I love all the benefits from this product, it’s a game changer and will definitely repurchase 👌🏼 #innisfree #kbeauty #skincare #skincareroutine",

It kind of heats up on the skin a little. It also really sucks out the gunk and it’s super affordable. $15 for this tub!! I use this once a week and pair it with the Inkey List BHA serum.What are some clay masks you use? #innisfree #claymask #skinstagram #skinsta #instaskincarecommunity #volcanicclaymask #skincaretips #skincarehacks #minimizepores #texturethursday",

        "caption":"Happy Thursday, my darlings! 💗✨Today I&#39;m going to talk about another innisfreeofficial innisfreeindia sunscreen that I really adore. I really disliked no sebum one. However, this sunscreen performs admirably. Innisfree Blueberry Rebalancing Watery Sun Cream is the name of this product.🔆The main sunscreen ingredient is titanium dioxide. It&#39;s a mineral-based sunscreen and has a spf of 45 and a PA+++ rating. 🔆Let&#39;s talk about texture for a moment. It&#39;s white in colour and has a runny cream texture. This thing is insanely light. The majority of sunscreens feel quite thick. This one, on the other hand, feels like any other light moisturiser🙀😻 🔆Because it&#39;s so light, it won&#39;t feel like it&#39;s weighing down your face with all these layers, this will be ideal for reapplication. Like the rest of the blueberry line, it has a subtle cirtusy aroma. However, after you massage it in, it vanishes. 🔆 It&#39;s also very moisturising on the skin and doesn&#39;t leave a WHITE CAST, which is crucial to me👌🏽💯 🔆It doesn&#39;t feel dry on my face, and it doesn&#39;t make my skin oily. It also contains Houttuynia Cordata Extract, as well as Centella and Blueberry Extracts for skin soothing. The quantity of this product is its only drawback❌. It comes in a 40 ml tube and will barely last two months if you use it every day+ reapplication. Purchased from mynykaa",

        "caption":"Wine to exfoliate and smooth your skin? Yes absolutely! innisfreeindia recently launched Wine 🍷 Peeling Jelly Softener enriched with wine extracts clear and smooth skin. Its formulated with powerful anti oxidative polyphenol to revitalise your skin. It’s white clear in colour with grape 🍇 wine essence. First time I tested it over my hands with out cotton, I poured a bit of jelly softener on my hands, applied it evenly, I rubbed my hands and I noticed it 💯 exfoliates skin removing dead cells, moisturises skin and further refreshes skin leaving it smooth and clean. It’s 💯 mild and gentle on skin. Suitable to all types of skin. I totally recommend this product.———————————————————————————thebeautycrunch innisfreeindia mynykaa hypebaebeauty——————————————————————————— #thebeautycrunch#beauty#lifestyle#beautybloggers#beautycommunity#skincare#skincareroutine#skin#innisfreewinepeelingjellysoftener#innisfree#koreanskincare#mynykaa",

It’s a great way to moisten and prep my skin for the application of my serums with something a bit more impactful than just water as this has #niacinamide in it and the serum that I’m currently does not. It also smells so lovely and floral, which makes doing your skincare routine that little bit more enjoyable 😌 I’m really interested in toners now! Tell me about your favourite one - what does it add to your skincare routine?",
